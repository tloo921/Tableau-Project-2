### Analysis Completed:
#### Part 1: What is causing returns?
- Constructed "Returned" calculated field to show if items were returned for yes = 1 and null = 0.
- Built worksheets using new field for each of the following:
  - Scatterplot showing correlation between total sales and total returns.
  - Bar chart showing return rate by product category.
  - Return rate by customer. To find customers who are more prone to making returns, added filter to remove customers with only 1 order.
  - Map showing return rate by state to see if there was a geographic concentration to returned orders.
  - The return rate by month to see if there is a seasonal effect to returned orders.
  - Total returns for subcategory by month.

#### Part 2: Built dashboard for monitoring returns
- Made low fidelity mock up of dashboard with pen and paper with 3 variations to determine which would be best to tell the story.
- Created template for dashboard using empty containers to match mock ups.
- Finalized the dashboards with relevant markers, images, and titles as needed.

## Final Results:
- Machines, fasteners and chairs had the highest rates of return.
- Western region of U.S. had the highest return rates.
- Months in September and December had the highest amount of returns.
- **Recommendation made: Having sales/specials during the months of September and December as they typically mark going back to school periods and the holidays. This, along with better warranties and customer support may help reduce the return rates at the superstore**
